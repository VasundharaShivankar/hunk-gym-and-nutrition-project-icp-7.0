## Introduction
At Hunk Gym & Nutrition, we believe that building muscle isn’t just about hitting the gym hard; it’s also about fueling your body with the right foods. Whether you’re a seasoned lifter or just starting your fitness journey, our 7-day meal plan can help you achieve your goals. Here are some key takeaways to keep in mind:

- Caloric Surplus: To support muscle growth, aim for a caloric surplus of 300-500 calories per day.
- Protein Intake: Consume at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight daily, spread out over 3-6 meals. Opt for lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based options like beans and tofu.
- Complex Carbs: Fuel your workouts with complex carbs such as oats, rice, potatoes, and pastas.
- Healthy Fats: Don’t fear fat! Healthy fats from nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, and fatty fish are crucial for hormone production.
- Timing Matters: Consume protein and carbs before and after training to maximize muscle growth and recovery.
